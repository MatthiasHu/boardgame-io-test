# Some experimentation with the boardgame.io framework

I followed the [`boardgame.io` tutorial](https://boardgame.io/documentation/#/tutorial),
using React.

After cloning this repo, run `npm install`.
(This creates `./node_modules`, taking up about 500MB.)
Then we can serve the web app on a local web server by `npm start`
and run a local gamemaster server (backend) by `npm run gamemaster-server`
in another terminal.
